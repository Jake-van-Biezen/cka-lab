# ðŸ§ª cka-lab

**cka-lab** is a CLI tool for creating and testing hands-on Kubernetes exercises, designed to help you (or your students) prepare for the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) exam.

Each exercise spins up a **fresh Kubernetes cluster**, applies predefined **scaffolded resources**, and can run **automated checks** to verify correctness â€” all from the command line.
